‚ö° ANPR - AUTOMATIC NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION SYSTEM

‚ñ™Introduction-
Automatic Number Plate Recognition System(ANPR) is a practical application of image processing that uses a number plate to identify the vehicle. 
It enables computer systems to read the registration number (license number) of vehicles from digital pictures automatically. 
Reading automatically the registration number means transforming the pixels of the digital image into the ASCII text of the number plate.OCR technology scans paper documents and turns them into electronic, editable files. 
Capturing fast-moving vehicles needs a unique technique to avoid motion blur. 
To ensure the right image quality short shutter time is used with high-power illumination.


‚ñ™APPLICATIONS -
Traffic Control
PUC
Tax Validity
Insurance Validity
Stolen Cars
Vehicle Surveillance


‚ñ™Objective -
Enhancing security
Improving traffic management
Law enforcement
Toll collection
Parking management


‚ñ™Problem Statement -
The Automatic Number Plate Recognition System is the identification system of vehicles. 
It is an image-processing technology used to identify vehicles only by their license plates. 
Automatic Number Plate Recognition ANPR plays a major role in the management of parking areas and surveillance of illegally parked vehicles. Since every vehicle has a unique number plate so its number plate can identify it. 
The classification is utilized for the electronic toll-collection system (ETC) and to display available parking spaces to vehicles. 
The identification is also employed for managing parking facilities, monitoring and analysis of traveling time, and security systems such as observation of stolen vehicles and monitoring of unauthorized vehicles entering private areas.


‚ñ™Key Features -
High Accuracy Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an essential requirement.
Technology image acquisition technology determines the average image quality the number plate recognition algorithm has to work on.


‚ñ™Methodology -
Images of the Rear License plate are taken from the real environment.
Pre-Process Digital Images of License Plates by Grey-scale conversion, Noise Reduction, and Contrast enhancement using histogram equalization.
Application of the proposed method localization/segmentation of the license plate.

‚ö°Conclusion -
In conclusion, automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems have proven to be a valuable technology in a range of applications, including law enforcement, traffic management, and toll collection. 
ANPR systems use cameras and software to read license plates and convert them into a digital format for further processing. 
While ANPR systems offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and accuracy, concerns have been raised about privacy and security. 
It is important that any ANPR system is implemented with appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of individuals, such as data encryption and access controls.
Overall, ANPR systems have the potential to improve public safety and streamline various processes, but it is important to ensure that they are implemented responsibly and ethically
